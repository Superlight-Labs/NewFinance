## 🚀 Benefits of using Superlight

### Free transactions

Send, receive or do whatever you want with your stablecoins, for free. (Additional tokens included)

### Fully banking compatible

Don’t be cut off. Use SEPA and Wiretransfer, without owning Fiat.
Debitcards are in the planning.

### No Know-How required

You don’t know anything about blockchains or crypto? That's not necessary. We abstract all the complicated stuff away.
