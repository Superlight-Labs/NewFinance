First of all a __big__ thank you for wanting to contribute to this library. üèÜ

In order for this to be maintainable we ask you to follow these rules when contributing.

* work off of and make your pull request to the `dev` branch. Master is meant to reflect what's published to npm, think git flow.
* make sure that you understand how this library works and utilize what's already in place, try not to introduce new complexity unless properly motivated.
* motivate why you've made the changes you have made in the PR description.
* make sure your implementation doesn't break anything, step through all the StoryBook stories and make sure everything look as expected. Also make sure that the circleci builds are passing.
* create one (or several) new story/stories that showcases your new feature
* fork [`react-native-svg-charts-examples`](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) and make a PR with your newly implementes stories (include screenshots).
