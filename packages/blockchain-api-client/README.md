## Description

Blockchain Api Client which maps Results of all supported Blockchain API's into a unified interface

## Motivation

There are many Blockchain API's out there. For many use-cases it is usefull to ask multiple API's for the same information.
Normally this results in a lot of different interfaces and necessary logic to just display the data.

This Package Defines unified interfaces and automatically maps responses into those interfaces.

## Supported as of Now

| Api Supported | Bitcoin | Ethereum    |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Tatum         | X       | Coming soon |
| Blockcypther  | X       | Coming soon |

## Changes

This Packages is in a very early Stage. It is possible that you use this and some interface doesnt make perfect sense to you.
In this case you have 3 options

1. Raise an Issue in our [Repository](https://github.com/lauhon/WalletPOC) (or even better a PR)
2. Create 1 Mapper from our Interface into yours (instead of X for every API/Blockchain)
3. Dont Use this Library :P
